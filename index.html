<p>Welcome to the domain for cheeseRox (formerly squareBracket).</p>
<p>We're coming back. I have successfully set up a Ubuntu installation on a Toshiba Satellite L550 laptop (weaker than the Asus laptop used for PokTube exactly a year ago).
The server will be way slower than the malfunctioning VPS that we used for nearly a year, but this is temporary. After my Acer Aspire TC-605 (main pc) gets fully upgraded,
A new server for cheeseRox will be built, using spare parts.</p>
